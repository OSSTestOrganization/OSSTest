## Code Style & Best Practices

Follow these conventions to ensure clean and maintainable code:

### General Guidelines
- Use **PascalCase** for class, method, and property names.
- Use **camelCase** for local variables and parameters.
- Ensure method and variable names are clear and desctriptive of their function.
- Name the boolean property with an affirmative phrase e.g. Enabled instead of Disabled.
- Empty lines should be used to separate the methods. Use only one empty line.
- Always surround statement by operator brackets even if it's one-line.
- In .Net Core, its is possible to have a appsettings.[environment].json. Any setting in the environment file will overwrite the settings in the normal appsettings.json file. Use these files when developing.
- Ensure **null-checks** and **exception handling**.
- Follow DRY and SOLID
- All switch-statements should have a default case.
